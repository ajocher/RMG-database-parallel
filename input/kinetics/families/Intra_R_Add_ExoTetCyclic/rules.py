The kinetics for head nodes of this family have been copied from "Cyclic_Ether_Formation" family,
"Cyclic_Ether_Formation" is a special case of "Intra_R_Add_ExoTetcyclic" family, to make this reaction family possible.
Seems even kinetics of "Cyclic_Ether_Formation" are just an initial guess.
More accurate rate parameters should be estimated for both reaction families.
